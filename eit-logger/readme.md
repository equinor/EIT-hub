# EIT-logger

Just a simple viewer of mqtt messages on the eit-hub.

## Getting started.

Before you start you need to set the mqtt username and password in index.html file.

Then you can open the index.html in the browser. (No server necessary)

Open development tools as mqtt messages are piped to the terminal.

## Troubleshoot
You may need to change the clientId if there is multiple users. Only one connection can have the same client id at the same time.
